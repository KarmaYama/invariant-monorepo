# Invariant Protocol

### The Anchor for the Artificial Age.

---

### The Internet has lost its "Proof of Personhood."

In an era where Artificial Intelligence can simulate human language, behavior, and creativity, the assumption that **"One Account = One Human"** is dead. The digital economy is flooding with bots, creating a crisis of trust that biometrics and passwords can no longer solve without invading your privacy.

**Invariant** is the solution. It is not a social network. It is not a wallet. It is infrastructure.

Invariant establishes a **Proof of Device** network. By anchoring your digital identity to the physical security chip inside your smartphone, we create a mathematical proof that you are real, unique, and persistent—without ever knowing who you are.

## ⚡ Why Invariant?

We believe identity should be **invisible**, **private**, and **valuable**.

### 1. Hardware, Not Heuristics

We don't analyze your behavior. We don't scan your iris. We communicate directly with the **Secure Enclave** (TEE) inside your phone—the same chip that secures your banking apps. If you have a physical device, you have a verified identity.

### 2. Zero-Load Interaction

Invariant respects your time. There are no daily tasks, no ads, and no "mining" games.

* **Genesis:** You tap once to generate your hardware-bound key.
* **Heartbeat:** The app proves your existence in the background via a low-data pulse.
* **That's it.** You are anchoring the network just by existing.

### 3. Absolute Privacy

Your biometrics (FaceID/Fingerprint) never leave your device. The Invariant Protocol verifies **hardware integrity**, not personal identity. We know *that* you are human, but we do not know *which* human you are.

## 🧬 How It Works

Invariant turns your smartphone into a **Hardware Anchor**.

1. **Attestation (The Handshake):** When you join, your phone generates a cryptographic certificate chain signed by the manufacturer (Google/Apple).
2. **Binding (The Lock):** The network verifies this certificate against the Global Hardware Root of Trust. If valid, a unique ID is minted.
3. **Persistence (The Pulse):** Your device sends a periodic, encrypted "heartbeat" to the network. This builds your **Continuity Score**—a measure of how long you have been a verified actor in the ecosystem.

> **Note:** This process consumes negligible battery and data (less than a text message per day).

## 📱 The User Experience

We built Invariant to be "Calm Software." It does not beg for your attention.

* **The Interface:** A minimalist dashboard showing your Anchor Status and Continuity Score.
* **The Tiers:**
* **Tier 1 (Titanium):** Devices with StrongBox/Secure Element (High Security).
* **Tier 2 (Steel):** Devices with Standard TEE (Standard Security).


* **The Utility:** In the future, your Invariant Identity will act as a "Fast Pass" for the internet—bypassing CAPTCHAs, granting access to exclusive platforms, and verifying you as a human in a world of AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Testnet V1)

We are currently in **Incentivized Testnet**. Early adopters help us stress-test the Sybil-resistance of the network.

1. **Download the Client:** Get the Invariant mobile app (APK available in Releases).
2. **Initialize Genesis:** Open the app and authenticate with your device's biometrics to generate your key.
3. **Stay Live:** Keep the app installed. Open it occasionally to sync your score.
4. **Join the Community:** Give feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ejY6tDCx).

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity

Invariant is built on the philosophy of **"Don't Trust, Verify."**

* **Open Source:** Our core logic is public.
* **Non-Custodial:** We cannot delete your identity. We cannot access your private key.
* **Anti-Emulator:** Our server enforces strict attestation rules. Emulators, rooted devices, and server farms are mathematically rejected.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

* **Phase 1 (Current):** Infrastructure Stress Test. Validating the "Cost of Forgery" economic model.
* **Phase 2:** Partner Integrations. Allowing third-party dApps to use Invariant for "Bot-Free" login.
* **Phase 3:** Mainnet Launch. Converting Continuity Scores into the decentralized governance layer.

### A Note on value

Invariant is not a "get rich quick" scheme. It is a **"prove you exist"** mechanism. By participating, you are helping build the guardrails for the future of the internet.

**Stand on Invariant.**
