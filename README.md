### The Anchor for the Digital Age

## The Problem: Lost Proof of Personhood

With AI generating realistic human behavior, the assumption **"one account = one human"** is broken. Bots and automated accounts flood platforms, undermining trust. Biometrics and passwords alone are no longer enough without compromising privacy.

**Invariant** is not a social network or a wallet—it is infrastructure. It provides **hardware-backed proof of existence**, establishing a cryptographically verifiable link between a human and their physical device.

## ⚡ Why Invariant Matters

Invariant ensures that digital identity is **private, persistent, and auditable**.

1. **Hardware-Backed Verification**  
   - Verifies the device’s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or Secure Element (StrongBox).  
   - Prevents emulator, rooted device, or server-farm abuse.  

2. **Minimal Interaction**  
   - Generate your identity with a single tap.  
   - Continuity scores update via background heartbeats with negligible battery/data use.  

3. **Absolute Privacy**  
   - No biometrics or personal data leave the device.  
   - The network validates **existence**, not identity.

## 🧬 How It Works

1. **Attestation:** Device generates a cryptographic certificate chain signed by the manufacturer.  
2. **Binding:** The chain is verified against the global hardware root of trust. A unique ID is minted.  
3. **Persistence:** Periodic encrypted heartbeats maintain a **Continuity Score**, reflecting verified presence over time.

> Battery and data impact is minimal (<1 text message/day).

## 📱 User Experience

- **Dashboard:** Displays Anchor Status and Continuity Score.  
- **Security Tiers:**  
  - **Titanium:** StrongBox/Secure Element devices (high security).  
  - **Steel:** Standard TEE devices (standard security).  
- **Future Utility:** Verified identities enable “bot-free” login, CAPTCHA bypass, and access to trusted services.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Testnet V1)

1. Download the mobile client (APK in Releases).  
2. Generate your hardware-bound key using your device.  
3. Keep the app installed and periodically open to sync your score.  
4. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/ejY6tDCx) for early feedback.

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity

- **Open Source:** Core logic is publicly auditable.  
- **Non-Custodial:** Private keys never leave the device.  
- **Anti-Emulator:** Only physical, uncompromised devices are accepted.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Testnet & stress-test Sybil-resistance.  
2. **Phase 2:** Partner integrations for bot-free services.  
3. **Phase 3:** Mainnet & decentralized governance layer leveraging Continuity Scores.

## A Note on Value

Invariant is not a financial instrument—it is a **mathematically auditable proof of human existence**. Early participants help shape the foundation of a trustworthy digital ecosystem.

**Stand on Invariant.**
